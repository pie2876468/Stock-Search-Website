# Stock-Search-Website
Design a Responsive Website.
This project is designed to show the information of stock.
I mainly practice AnjularJS, AJAX, JQuery, Bootstrap.

The backend file contains PHP version and Node.js version. Both of them works.

Use Alpha Vantage API to get stock Information.
Use Hightchart to show data.

(The API key can be applied from https://www.alphavantage.co/)

For FB function, please, apply your own application id.
